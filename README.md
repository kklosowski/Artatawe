# Artatawe design document

## How to contribute to the content:

In order to allow for easy contribution to the project, we are using GitHub; it is easy to keep track of changes
and manage versions of the files, but in order to stay platform-neutral we are using *Markdown* files. (The ones ending with **.md**).

**Markdown** as the name suggests is the simple markdown language which allows for structuring documents in few basic ways.

The code from `content.md` will later be imported into some more advanced word processor (i.e. *Word*, *Google Docs* or *Pages*) where it will be styled and exported to PDF for assessment.

Following is the code from [Wikipedia - Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example):

## Sample Code:

```
# Heading

## Sub-heading

### Another deeper heading

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line leave a
line break.

Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. apples
  2. oranges
  3. pears

A [link](http://example.com).
```
