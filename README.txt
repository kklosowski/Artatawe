I chose to work on an old version of Artatawe which has no features from A2 implemented(My group chose to work on an example project for A2) 
and some of the funtionality is missing. This however shouldn't affect the features implemented for A3.

Features implemented:
Wish List

Edited classes for the purpose of A3:
AuctionController.java
LayoutController.java
WishListController.java
AuctionDao.java


To compile use:
mvn package
java -cp target/Artatawe-1.0.jar artatawe.MainHandler
